1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

    The terminal is where you give instructions to tell the computer what to do. It is text 
    based which means you can type out "commands" as those instructions. You can also view the results of 
    your commands from the same terminal.


2. What is the major difference between Git and GitHub?

    Git is ran on your personal machine that deals with managing your source code's history; it is a version control system,
